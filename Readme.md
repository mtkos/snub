## snub uniform star polyhedra

This repository is a companion to my 'uniform' repository. It contains a set of small Python and Sagemath programs related to snub uniform star polyhedra. The 'vertex' map contains programs to
obtain exact coordinates for them. By 'exact' I mean symbolic expressions, no numerical approximation. The 'star' map contains programs for displaying these polyhedra, using open3d. Exact
coordinates are, of course, not needed to do this, everything can be done numerically at once. But this helps discovering (easily made) mistakes in the exact coordinates.
